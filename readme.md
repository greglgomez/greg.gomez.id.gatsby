ðŸ‘‹ hey there, welcome my digital garden! 

I'm Greg Gomez, a digital project manager who for the past few years has been diving into the world of [[permaculture]].

## my story
with 8 years experience with digital project management, I've grown dissatisfied with the tech industry: it's effects on the planet, it's effect on society and the way value is amassed in the hands of the few. I've been on a journey to find a better way to live my life and earn a living that doesn't sacrifice my personal ethics.

This here digital garden is where I will be documenting my research and thoughts on my [[areas]] of interest, as well as working out loud on my [[proje cts]]. I'm particularly interested in [[distributed-cooperative-organisations]] and other systems of shared value production, both on a local & global scale.
