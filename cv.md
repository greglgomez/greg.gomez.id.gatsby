### BA Digital Media Production @ Arts University Bournemouth

After exploring myriad technologies and techniques in my first two years, in my 3rd and final year I decided to hone down. My focus was around big data, data visualisation and the quantified self.

My projects explored self-discovery through meta data using all the tools at my disposal. I experimented with SQL and Mongo to manage the streams of data I was generating and first produced an infographic with all the interesting information I gathered over the period of a month.

My final Major Project developed this idea by serving a (quasi)real-time web page with my quantified self data and insight fed by a personal API.
